# Teebay Mobile App - Technical Documentation

## Overview

Teebay is a React Native mobile application for product renting and buying/selling, built with Expo and integrated with a Django backend. The app provides a comprehensive marketplace experience with user authentication, product management, transaction handling, and push notifications.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with theme support
- **Authentication**: Biometric authentication with Expo LocalAuthentication
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Notifications with Firebase integration

### Backend Integration

- **API**: Django REST Framework
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication
- **Real-time**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
- **Base URL**: Configurable via environment variables

## Part 1: Authentication & User Management

### Implementation Details

#### Biometric Authentication

- **Location**: Integrated into login flow as optional feature
- **Implementation**: Uses `expo-local-authentication` for fingerprint/FaceID
- **Security**: Biometric data is not stored; only user preference is saved
- **UX Flow**:
  1. User attempts login
  2. System prompts for biometric authentication (if enabled)
  3. Fallback to manual login if biometric fails
  4. User can enable/disable biometric auth from profile settings

#### User Registration & Login

- **Forms**: Custom form components with validation
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with error handling
- **State Management**: Zustand store for user session
- **Persistence**: Secure token storage with AsyncStorage

### Key Components

- `AuthGuard`: Route protection component
- `BiometricPrompt`: Biometric authentication component
- `AuthButton`: Reusable authentication button
- `AuthInput`: Form input with validation

## Part 2: Product Management

### Multi-Step Product Form

- **Design**: Matches wireframe requirements with step-by-step navigation
- **Steps**:
  1. Product Details (title, description, condition)
  2. Categories (multi-select from predefined categories)
  3. Pricing (purchase price, rent price, rent options)
  4. Images (multiple image upload)
  5. Review (summary before submission)

#### Categories Implementation

- **Predefined Categories**: ELECTRONICS, FURNITURE, HOME APPLIANCES, SPORTING GOODS, OUTDOOR, TOYS
- **Multi-select**: Products can belong to multiple categories
- **UI**: Horizontal scrollable category chips
- **Validation**: At least one category must be selected

#### Product CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Multi-step form with validation
- **Read**: Product listing with search, filter, and sort
- **Update**: Edit existing products (owner only)
- **Delete**: Remove products with confirmation dialog

### Key Components

- `ProductForm`: Main multi-step form component
- `MultiStepForm`: Reusable step navigation component
- `ProductCard`: Product display component
- `CategoryChip`: Category selection component

## Part 3: Transactions & Marketplace

### Product Listing & Discovery

- **Performance**: Optimized for high data volume (tested with mass data script)
- **Features**:
  - Search functionality
  - Category filtering
  - Sorting options (date, price, name, category)
  - Grid/List view toggle
  - Pagination support

### Transaction System

- **Buy Transactions**: One-time purchase
- **Rent Transactions**: Time-based rental with flexible periods (hour, day, week, month)
- **Transaction History**: Separate views for purchases and rentals
- **Status Tracking**: PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED, RETURNED

#### Transaction Flow

1. User browses products
2. Selects buy or rent option
3. Confirms transaction details
4. Transaction is created and confirmed
5. Push notification sent to seller
6. Transaction appears in user's history

### Push Notifications

- **Implementation**: Firebase Cloud Messaging via Expo
- **Trigger**: Backend sends notifications on transaction events
- **Navigation**: Tapping notification navigates to relevant product page
- **Platform**: Android implementation (as specified)

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Architecture

```typescript
// Auth Store (Zustand)
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  token: string | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  biometricEnabled: boolean;
}

// App Store (Zustand)
interface AppState {
  theme: "light" | "dark";
  notifications: Notification[];
}
```

### API Integration

- **Base Service**: Centralized API service with error handling
- **Query Management**: TanStack Query for caching and synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with API response types

### Component Architecture

- **Reusable Components**: Common UI components in `/src/components/common/`
- **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components organized by feature
- **Form Components**: Specialized form components with validation
- **Layout Components**: Consistent layout and navigation components

### Performance Optimizations

- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading and caching for product images
- **List Performance**: Virtualized lists for large datasets
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient data fetching with proper caching
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of subscriptions and timers

## Corner Cases & Solutions

### 1. Rent Time Overlap

- Clear error messages
- Option to disable biometric auth
- Support for multiple biometric methods

### 4. Large Dataset Performance

**Problem**: App performance with thousands of products
**Solution**:

- Pagination for product lists
- Virtualized scrolling
- Image lazy loading
- Efficient search and filtering

### 5. Image Upload Failures

**Problem**: Image upload failures due to size or format issues
**Solution**:
